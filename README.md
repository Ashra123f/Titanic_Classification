# Titanic_Classification
The Titanic classification refers to the prediction task of classifying passengers on the Titanic into two categories: those who survived and those who didn't. It's a common machine learning exercise used to teach classification algorithms. The dataset typically includes features like age, sex, class, and fare, which are used to train a model that can predict whether a given passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on those features. This task helps people learn about data preprocessing, feature engineering, and different classification algorithms.
